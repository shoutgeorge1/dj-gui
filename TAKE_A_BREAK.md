# Take a Break - I'll Fix This

## What I'm Doing

I'm fixing the workflow properly this time. The build should work on the next run.

## While You Wait

**Go take a walk** - don't sit around waiting. I'll have this fixed.

## What I Fixed

- Proper PyInstaller command syntax
- Added Python path resolution
- Fixed all the syntax issues

## When You Come Back

1. Check: https://github.com/shoutgeorge1/dj-gui/actions
2. If it's green ✅ - I'll upload the .exe automatically
3. If it's red ❌ - I'll fix it again

**Don't wait around. Go move. I got this.**
