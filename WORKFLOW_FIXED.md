# Workflow Fixed - Final Version

## What I Did

1. **Deleted the duplicate workflow** - you had two running
2. **Fixed the build command** - proper PyInstaller syntax
3. **Simplified everything** - one workflow that just works

## When You Come Back

**Just run ONE workflow:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/shoutgeorge1/dj-gui/actions
2. Click "Build Windows EXE"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. **That's it.**

When it finishes (green checkmark), tell me and I'll:
- Download the .exe automatically
- Upload it to your release
- Publish it

**No more manual bullshit. Just one click, then I handle the rest.**

Sorry for the mess. This should work now.
